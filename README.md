# COMP206-Software-Systems-W2020
Hello guys. 

I am a COMP 206 TA this Winter 2020. My name is Ridwan Kurmally. I will be posting my solutions to the labs as the semester goes by.
They are available to everyone. I hope that this will be a good resource for all of you.

My TA Schedule is not fixed for the time being. Check this google calendar for upates:

Lab solution posted up to date:

Lab A : Introduction to COMP 206

Lab B : VIM (SKIPPED)

Lab C : Bash

Lab D : Sessions and C Compile

Lab E : C Arrays and I/O

Lab F : Pointers and Functions

Lab G : Struct and Dynamic Memory

Lab H : Makefile and Git (See README.md for link to Zoom Lab video)


Note: I have skipped Lab B - VIM as the lab itself is pretty self-explanatory in itself and it is
very difficult for me to show how to use VIM in pictures or code.

To import this solution repository on Mimi, enter the following command on the mimi terminal:

git clone https://github.com/Ridwan2606/COMP206-Software-Systems-W2020.git


To delete the solution repository from Mimi, enter the following command on the mimi terminal (assuming the solution folder is in your
current directory):

rm -rf COMP206-Software-Systems-W2020



Thank you!

-Ridwan
