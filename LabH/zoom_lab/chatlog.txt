11:55:27	 From  Amirsha Ridwan Nabee Kurmally, Mr : Lab starting at 12:00
11:59:58	 From  Amirsha Ridwan Nabee Kurmally, Mr : Hey guys, When you join the lab, keep yourself muted and video turned off. There's a raise hand reaction. Use that to get my attention. When I noticed that someone raised their hand, I will pause and you can unmute yourself to ask your question. After that, please go back to being muted so that I can proceed with the lab. Thank you!
12:01:04	 From  Sivagamy Sriranganathan : yes
12:05:18	 From  Saad shahbaz : I have a question. Can we put #include <stdio.h> in a header file?
12:05:47	 From  Saad shahbaz : Because I was getting an error when I was using it in a .h file
12:05:49	 From  Saad shahbaz : Okay sure
12:10:54	 From  sympi : So only variable declarations and function names are put into the .h file?
12:12:39	 From  Sivagamy Sriranganathan : Can you remind me of what -> does again?

12:13:51	 From  Sivagamy Sriranganathan : Yes thank you
12:23:06	 From  Saad shahbaz : quick question, can we use .c files in MakeFile
12:23:28	 From  Saad shahbaz : like i was getting an error when i used .c
12:23:34	 From  Saad shahbaz : i had to write a .h file
12:23:42	 From  Saad shahbaz : then it worked perfectly fine
12:24:01	 From  Saad shahbaz : yess
12:24:03	 From  Saad shahbaz : exactly
12:24:10	 From  Saad shahbaz : like utils is used in poly

12:40:03	 From  Sivagamy Sriranganathan : the order is important right?
12:41:19	 From  Sivagamy Sriranganathan : so the final compilation is at top?

12:42:58	 From  Sivagamy Sriranganathan : The makefile only reads the first command by default?
